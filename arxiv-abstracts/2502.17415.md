## Abstract

For a discrete colored operad $P$, we construct an adjunction between the category of dendroidal sets over the nerve of $P$ and the category of simplicial $P$-algebras, and prove that when $P$ is $\Sigma$-free it establishes a Quillen equivalence with respect to the covariant model structure on the former category and the projective model structure on the latter. When $P=A$ is a discrete category, this recovers a Quillen equivalence previously established by Heuts-Moerdijk, of which we provide an independent proof.
  To prove the constructed adjunction is a Quillen equivalence, we show that the left adjoint presents a previously established operadic straightening equivalence between $\infty$-categories. This involves proving that, for a discrete symmetric monoidal category $A$, the Heuts-Moerdijk equivalence is a monoidal equivalence of monoidal Quillen model categories.
