## Abstract

Here, we demonstrate that a set of coherent measurements leverages semi-device-independent (SDI) steering and local randomness generation. To this end, we show that coherent measurements are a necessary resource for demonstrating SDI steering. Conversely, through one-to-one mapping of an SDI steerable correlation to a set of measurements, the coherence of the measurements, in turn, is a necessary and sufficient criterion for SDI steering. This result aligns with the relationship between the standard steering scenario and the measurement incompatibility. Then a nonconvex resource theory for SDI steering is formulated and a nonconvex monotone of the resource is obtained in the two-setting scenario using the above-mentioned one-to-one mapping. Finally, we apply this monotone to the quantification of local randomness from two-qubit states without requiring entanglement to be certified.
