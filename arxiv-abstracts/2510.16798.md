## Abstract

This work studies stochastic interventions in continuous-time event-history settings formulated as multiplicative scalings of the observed intensity governing an intermediate event process. This gives rise to a family of causal estimands indexed by a scalar parameter {\alpha}, which changes the event rate while preserving the temporal and covariate structure of the data-generating process. We introduce calibrated interventions, where \(\alpha\) is chosen to achieve a pre-specified goal, such as a desired level of cumulative risk of the intermediate event, and define corresponding composite target parameters capturing the resulting effects on the outcome process. Our proposal enables practical yet statistically principled intervention analysis in survival and longitudinal settings, which offers a flexible alternative to deterministic or static interventions that are often ill-defined. The framework applies broadly to causal questions involving time-to-event treatments or mediators, and offers a pragmatic analogue to indirect/direct effect decompositions. We present the efficient influence curves for various versions of target parameters under a nonparametric statistical model, discuss their double robustness properties, and propose an estimation procedure based on targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). The proposed estimands are illustrated through examples of event-history scenarios addressing distinct causal questions.
