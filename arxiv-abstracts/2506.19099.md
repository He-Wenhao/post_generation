## Abstract

The cosmic time dilation observed in Type Ia supernova light curves suggests that the passage of cosmic time varies throughout the evolution of the Universe. This observation implies that the rate of proper time is not constant, as assumed in the standard FLRW metric, but instead is time-dependent. Consequently, the commonly used FLRW metric should be replaced by a more general framework, known as the Conformal Cosmology (CC) metric, to properly account for cosmic time dilation. The CC metric incorporates both spatial expansion and time dilation during cosmic evolution. As a result, it is necessary to distinguish between comoving and proper (physical) time, similar to the distinction made between comoving and proper distances. In addition to successfully explaining cosmic time dilation, the CC metric offers several further advantages: (1) it preserves Lorentz invariance, (2) it maintains the form of Maxwell's equations as in Minkowski space-time, (3) it eliminates the need for dark matter and dark energy in the Friedmann equations, and (4) it successfully predicts the expansion and morphology of spiral galaxies in agreement with observations.
