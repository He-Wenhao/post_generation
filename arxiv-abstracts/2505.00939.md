## Abstract

Differential logical relations are a method to measure distances between higher-order programs. They differ from standard methods based on program metrics in that differences between functional programs are themselves functions, relating errors in input with errors in output, this way providing a more fine grained, contextual, information. The aim of this paper is to clarify the metric nature of differential logical relations. While previous work has shown that these do not give rise, in general, to (quasi-)metric spaces nor to partial metric spaces, we show that the distance functions arising from such relations, that we call quasi-quasi-metrics, can be related to both quasi-metrics and partial metrics, the latter being also captured by suitable relational definitions. Moreover, we exploit such connections to deduce some new compositional reasoning principles for program differences.
